# International-food-court-project
-- 1. Background and overview --
International Premium outlet opened in 1989. It's a mall in Orlando, Florida. The mall is a place where everyone can get away from their everyday lives and buy accessories and food to suit each individual's taste. 

Looking into The company's findings about each data and what we can obtain. We looked into menu items, item names, a category that each menu was in, and the price. Before starting I did a cleaning of the data set using Excel and as well as the second data set. The second data set name is order details and within that set, we are looking at the order date, order time, item ID, and order ID, as well as the order detail ID. 

 -- My objection was to dig and find into customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what what the top customer seems to like best?

 -- Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu 
 -- Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that's been colleted 
 -- use both table to understande how customers are reactine to the new menu.

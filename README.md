# International-food-court-project
-- 1. Background and overview --
International Premium outlet opened in 1989. It's a mall in Orlando, Florida. The mall is a place where everyone can get away from their everyday lives and buy accessories and food to suit each individual's taste. 

Looking into The company's findings about each data and what we can obtain. We looked into menu items, item names, a category that each menu was in, and the price. Before starting I did a cleaning of the data set using Excel and as well as the second data set. The second data set name is order details and within that set, we are looking at the order date, order time, item ID, and order ID, as well as the order detail ID. 

 -- My objection was to dig and find into customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customer seems to like best?

 -- Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu 
 -- Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that's been colleted 
 -- use both table to understande how customers are reactine to the new menu. 

 

-- 2. Data struture overview -- 
The data set that I had on the on the restaurant that we are looking at and the two data set we have is menu items and order details.

-- 3. Excutive summary -- 
Stake holder goals for me was to dig and find into customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customer seems to like best? What I found out was out of the four category the Asian dishes was order more and American dishes where order least but Hambugers was the dishe that was odrer more.

Above is a link to the tableau public dashbored of the visual of the finding.





-- 4. insight Deep dive -- 

 - As I was looking into deeper finding and what I found out the average dish price of each catogory and the Italian dish prices was more then the Asian.
 - So I wanted to get into deeper finding into is the the highest to lowest dish price and what I noticed that the Schrimp scampi is the most expensive coasting 19.95 and the least was Edamame coasting 5 dollars. We can say that it coast more to make or prep for a Schrimp Scamp then Edamame  
 - Now I wanted to look into of which order had the most number of items purchase and how much the order was was in those purchase. The highest amount of items that was in a order was 14 items and the highest purches and on SQL I found the hightest purchase made was $192.15. 



-- 5. Recommendation -- 

1. Now meeting back with the stakeholder and what recommendation to give them. And soughting out throught the data, picking an asian style restuarant we seem to be recommed because leading toward most order from the public is choicing between the rest. It could be many reason but I recommed looking into the average price between the each catagory and look into the coast of making Asian dishes. 
2.  Having an American optition. While analitying the data we can see that Hamburger did very well 2023. It could be for may reason but I recommend looking into the age group for each order that was made and or look into each order and find out whitch dish category ever dish it was in.

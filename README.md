# International-food-court-project

-- 1. Background and overview --
International Premuim outlet open up in 1989. It's an one of the the mall that lives in Orlando florida. The mall is a place that everyone can get away from their everday life and that they can buy accessories and food for a taste for each individual. 

Looking into The company finding about the each data and what we can obtain. We looked into menu item, item name, category that each menu was in and the price. Before starting I did clean the data set using excel and as well as the second data set. The second data set name is order details and within that set we are looking at the order date, order time, item id, and order id, and as well of order detail id. 
**
 -- My objection was to dig and find into customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what what the top customer seems to like best?

 -- Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu 
 -- Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that's been colleted 
 -- use both table to understande how customers are reactine to the new menu.

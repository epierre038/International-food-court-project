# International-food-court-project
-- 1. Background and overview --
International Premium outlet opened in 1989. It's a mall in Orlando, Florida. The mall is a place where everyone can get away from their everyday lives and buy accessories and food to suit each individual's taste. 

Looking into The company's findings about each data and what we can obtain. We looked into menu items, item names, the category that each menu was in, and the price. Before starting I did a cleaning of the data set using Excel and as well as the second data set. The second data set name is order details and within that set, we are looking at the order date, order time, item ID, and order ID, as well as the order detail ID. 

 -- My objection was to dig and find into customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customer seems to like best.

 -- Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu 
 -- Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that's been collected 
 -- Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu. 

 

-- 2. Data structure overview -- 
The data set that I had on the restaurant that we are looking at and the two data set we have is menu items and order details.

-- 3. Executive summary -- 
Stakeholder goals for me were to dig and find into customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customer seems to like best. What I found out was out of the four categories the Asian dishes were ordered more and American dishes were ordered least but Hamburgers were the dishes that were ordered more.

-- 4. insight Deep dive -- 

 - As I was looking into deeper findings I found out the average dish price of each category and the Italian average dish prices were more than the Asian.
 - So I wanted to get deeper finding into the highest to lowest dish prices and I noticed that the Shrimp scampi was the most expensive costing 19.95 and the least was the Edamame costing 5 dollars. We can say that it costs more to make or prep for a Shrimp Scamp than Edamame  
 - Now I wanted to look into which order had the most number of items purchased and how much the order was in those purchases. The highest amount of items that were in order was 14 items and the highest purchases on SQL I found was $192.15. 
 


-- 5. Recommendation -- 

1. Now meeting back with the stakeholders and what recommendation to give them. And found out through the data, that picking an Asian-style restaurant. We seem to be recommended. Leading toward most order from the public is choosing between the rest of the category. It could be many reasons but I recommend looking into the average price between each category and look into the cost of making Asian dishes. 

2.  Having an American option. While analyzing the data we can see that Hamburger which is an American dish category did very well in 2023 but not the category only the dish. It could be for many reasons but I recommend looking into the age group for each order that was made and or look into how many time each dish was ordered in the Asian category
